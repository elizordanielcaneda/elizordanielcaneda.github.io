			I admit that one of my weaknesses is time management and taking on too much responsibility, which can conflict with the actual time in which I prefer to get projects completed. One of my most weaknesses is that I am a major procrastinator. Some of my schoolworks reached its deadline before I do it. Despite of it, I'm doing my best to improve myself to overcome my weaknesses in order for me to do my jobs on time.
