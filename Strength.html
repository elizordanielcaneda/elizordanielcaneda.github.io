			As a student I have many good qualities. I have learned to distinguish my strengths as a student. The most important thing is that I have a desire to improve with my studies. Another thing that I am proud of is my skills in computer. I am a fast learner when it comes to computer. I also have determination to reach my goals. Example of it is to pursue my goals in order for me to attend college. In addition to that, I acknowledge my mistakes and am willing to seek for knowledge for me to be better.
